# Third-party notices

Hordes of Azeroth is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (see `LICENSE`). It builds on, ships with or downloads the following projects, each under its own licence.

Hordes of Azeroth is not affiliated with or endorsed by Blizzard Entertainment. It contains no Blizzard files: the launcher builds everything it needs from the player's own World of Warcraft 1.12.1 client on the player's PC.

| Project | Used for | Licence | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VMaNGOS | The game server (our fork: `server/core`) | GPL-2.0 | https://github.com/vmangos/core |
| VMaNGOS world database | The base of the shipped world database (`world-db`), with our changes applied | GPL-2.0 | https://github.com/vmangos/core/releases |
| ClassicAPI | Extra addon API in the client | GPL-3.0 | https://github.com/brues-code/ClassicAPI |
| MariaDB Server | The local database | GPL-2.0 | https://mariadb.org |
| vanilla-tweaks | Several of the client exe patches in `config/client-patches.json` | MIT | https://github.com/brndd/vanilla-tweaks |
| VanillaFixes | Client fixes and DLL loading | MIT | https://github.com/hannesmann/vanillafixes |
| wow_turbo | Faster client code for crowded fights (`mods/wow_turbo`, v1.13.3, AVX and SSE builds) | MIT | https://github.com/athei/wow-mods |
| DXVK | Direct3D 9 to Vulkan (ships inside the VanillaFixes DXVK download) | zlib/libpng | https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk |
| Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable | Runtime DLLs next to the server and map tools | Microsoft Software License Terms (redistributable files) | https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist |

MariaDB, VanillaFixes, DXVK and ClassicAPI are downloaded by the launcher from their own release pages; wow_turbo's release DLLs ship unchanged in our `wow-turbo` package; the VMaNGOS-based server is built from the fork's source, which is published alongside this repository.
